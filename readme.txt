Seamlessly display apprenticeship vacancies from the official UK Government service via a simple shortcode and automated syncing.
== Description ==
Apprenticeship Connect integrates with the official UK Government's Find an Apprenticeship service to fetch and display current apprenticeship vacancies on your WordPress site. It provides a setup wizard for easy configuration, automated daily data synchronisation, and a simple shortcode to place vacancy listings anywhere on your site.

Features:
- **Easy Onboarding:** A step-by-step setup wizard guides you through the configuration process.
- **API Integration:** Connects to the UK Government apprenticeship API to fetch the latest vacancies.
- **Automated Syncing:** A daily WP-Cron job keeps your vacancy listings up-to-date automatically.
- **Manual Control:** A "Test & Sync" button in the settings allows for on-demand API testing and data synchronisation.
- **Simple Shortcode:** Use `[apprenticeship_vacancies]` to display listings on any page or post.
- **Customisable Display:** Control which vacancy details (employer, location, closing date) are shown directly from the settings page.

Shortcode:
- Use `[apprenticeship_vacancies]` on any page. The output is controlled by the options configured on the **Settings** page.

== Installation ==
1. Upload the `apprenticeship-connect` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress 'Plugins' screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress.
3. You will be automatically redirected to the **Setup Wizard**. Follow the steps to configure your API credentials and display settings.
4. Add the shortcode `[apprenticeship_vacancies]` to any page to display vacancies.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Where do I get the API Subscription Key? =
Request access from the UK Government Apprenticeships service. Enter the key in Apprenticeship Connect > Settings.

= Is UKPRN required? =
No. The UKPRN is optional. If you provide one, the plugin will filter vacancies to show only those associated with your provider.

= How often are vacancies synced? =
The plugin schedules a daily sync via WP-Cron. You can also click the **Test & Sync** button on the settings page to update vacancies immediately.

= Can I control how many vacancies are shown and which fields appear? =
Yes. You can configure the default display count and the visibility of the employer, location, closing date, and apply button from the **Apprenticeship Connect > Settings** page.

= Does the shortcode accept parameters? =
No. To keep configuration simple and centralised, the shortcode does not accept parameters. All display options are managed from the plugin's **Settings** page.
